# Job Management REST API

This project demonstrates a simple Spring Boot application for managing job postings using RESTful services. It includes functionalities for adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving job posts. The project consists of the following key components:

## Project Structure

- **JobRepo.java**: A repository class that handles job data operations (CRUD operations) on an in-memory list of `JobPost` objects.
- **JobService.java**: A service layer that interacts with the repository and handles business logic.
- **JobRestController.java**: A REST controller that exposes HTTP endpoints for managing job posts.

---

## 1. **JobRepo.java**

This class acts as the data layer, storing job postings in memory.

### Key Methods:

- `getAllJobs()`: Retrieves all job posts.
- `addJob(JobPost jobPost)`: Adds a new job post to the list.
- `getJob(int jobPostId)`: Retrieves a job post by its ID.
- `updateJob(JobPost jobPost)`: Updates the details of an existing job post.
- `delete(int postId)`: Deletes a job post by its ID.

**Answer**:
In `JobRepo`, job data is managed in an `ArrayList`. The data includes job posts like Java Developer and C Developer, each having attributes like `id`, `profile`, `description`, `required experience`, and `tech stack`.

---

## 2. **JobService.java**

This class serves as the business logic layer, interacting with `JobRepo` to perform operations.

### Key Methods:

- `addJob(JobPost jobPost)`: Calls `repo.addJob()` to add a job post.
- `getAllJobs()`: Calls `repo.getAllJobs()` to retrieve all jobs.
- `getJob(int jobPostId)`: Calls `repo.getJob()` to retrieve a job by ID.
- `updateJob(JobPost jobPost)`: Calls `repo.updateJob()` to update job details.
- `deleteJob(int postId)`: Calls `repo.delete()` to delete a job post by ID.

**Answer**:
In `JobService`, the methods are simple forwarding mechanisms to the `JobRepo`. This separation allows for clear business logic handling if needed later, ensuring that `JobRepo` handles raw data operations only.

---

## 3. **JobRestController.java**

This class defines the REST endpoints for managing job posts. It is annotated with `@RestController`, which automatically converts responses to JSON.

### Key Endpoints:

- `@GetMapping("/jobPosts")`: Retrieves all job posts.
- `@GetMapping("/JobPost/{jobPost}")`: Retrieves a job post by its ID.
- `@PostMapping("/JobPost")`: Adds a new job post (with request body containing the job details).
- `@PutMapping("/JobPost")`: Updates an existing job post.
- `@DeleteMapping("/jobPost/{postId}")`: Deletes a job post by its ID.

**Explanation**:

- **REST Controller vs Controller**: A `@RestController` automatically serializes Java objects into JSON responses, whereas a `@Controller` requires you to return `View` objects (e.g., JSP or Thymeleaf). `@RestController` is ideal for building RESTful web services.

- **@RequestBody**: This annotation is used to map the HTTP request body to a method parameter in the controller. In this case, it's used to bind JSON data to a `JobPost` object when adding or updating a job.

**Answer**:
The `JobRestController` provides RESTful APIs to interact with the service layer. It can handle job-related operations like fetching all jobs, adding, updating, or deleting jobs.

## Example Usage

### Adding a New Job
To add a job via HTTP POST request:
```bash
POST /JobPost
{
  "postId": 3,
  "postProfile": "Python Developer",
  "postDesc": "Experience with Django",
  "reqExperience": 2,
  "postTechStack": ["Python", "Django"]
}
```

### Fetching All Jobs
To retrieve all jobs via HTTP GET request:
```bash
GET /jobPosts
```

### Updating a Job
To update a job via HTTP PUT request:
```bash
PUT /JobPost
{
  "postId": 1,
  "postProfile": "Senior Java Developer",
  "postDesc": "Must have 5 years experience",
  "reqExperience": 5,
  "postTechStack": ["Core Java", "Spring", "Hibernate"]
}
```

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic job management system with CRUD operations using Spring Boot. The application follows best practices by separating the repository, service, and controller layers, which enhances scalability and maintainability.

### What is REST (Representational State Transfer)?

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style used for designing networked applications, primarily for creating web services. It operates over HTTP and defines a set of principles for structuring the interaction between client and server. RESTful services focus on **resources** (e.g., data entities like jobs, users, etc.), and each resource is identified by a unique URI.

### Key Concepts of REST:
- **Stateless Communication**: Each HTTP request from a client to the server must contain all the necessary information; the server does not retain the state of the client session between requests.
- **Uniform Interface**: RESTful services use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources:
    - `GET`: Retrieve a resource.
    - `POST`: Create a new resource.
    - `PUT`: Update an existing resource.
    - `DELETE`: Remove a resource.
- **Resource Representation**: Resources (like job posts) are represented in standard formats like JSON or XML, allowing different clients to interact with the service consistently.
- **Stateless Server**: Servers do not store client-specific information between requests, making the interaction stateless.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Because REST is stateless and has a uniform interface, it's easily scalable and can accommodate changes in the system without affecting client-side operations.

### REST vs Without REST (Traditional Spring MVC)

| **Aspect**            | **REST**                                                                 | **Without REST (Traditional Spring MVC)**                                           |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Purpose**    | Used to create **web services** that expose **data** (resources) over HTTP | Used to render **views** (HTML pages, JSP, etc.) that users interact with in browsers |
| **Controller**         | `@RestController` is used, and responses are usually **JSON** or **XML** | `@Controller` is used, and responses are **view templates** (HTML, JSP)             |
| **Response Type**      | Returns **data** directly (e.g., JSON, XML)                              | Returns **views/pages** (e.g., Thymeleaf, JSP)                                      |
| **Request Methods**    | Uses HTTP methods like **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE** to manage resources     | Typically handles **GET and POST** for interacting with views                       |
| **Statefulness**       | **Stateless**; no session data stored between requests                   | Can maintain **state** with session management                                      |
| **Usage Example**      | Fetching a list of jobs in JSON via a `GET /jobPosts` request            | Rendering a webpage with job details via a `GET /jobList` request                   |
| **Client Type**        | Used by **programmatic clients** like mobile apps, other web services    | Typically used by **human clients** interacting with a browser                      |
| **Example Response**   | **JSON**: `{ "postId": 1, "postProfile": "Java Developer" }`             | **HTML page**: `<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> Job details </body> </html>`          |

### How REST Works (Example with REST)

1. **Controller**:
    - With REST, you use `@RestController`, and the responses are data formats like JSON:
      ```java
      @RestController
      public class JobRestController {
          @GetMapping("/jobPosts")
          public List<JobPost> getAllJobs() {
              return jobService.getAllJobs(); // returns JSON response
          }
      }
      ```
    - When a client sends a `GET /jobPosts` request, the server responds with a list of job posts in **JSON format**:
      ```json
      [
        { "postId": 1, "postProfile": "Java Developer", "description": "2 years experience" },
        { "postId": 2, "postProfile": "C Developer", "description": "2 years experience" }
      ]
      ```

### How Traditional MVC Works (Without REST)

1. **Controller**:
    - In the traditional MVC approach, `@Controller` is used, and the methods return **view names**:
      ```java
      @Controller
      public class JobController {
          @GetMapping("/jobList")
          public String showJobList(Model model) {
              model.addAttribute("jobs", jobService.getAllJobs()); // binds data to the view
              return "jobListPage"; // returns a view name (like an HTML page)
          }
      }
      ```
    - When a client sends a `GET /jobList` request, the server responds with an **HTML page**:
      ```html
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Job List</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Java Developer - 2 years experience</li>
          <li>C Developer - 2 years experience</li>
        </ul>
      </body>
      </html>
      ```

### Summary of REST vs Without REST:

- **REST**: Used for building **APIs** where the main objective is to provide **data** to various clients (web browsers, mobile apps, etc.). Responses are usually in **JSON** or **XML**.
- **Traditional MVC**: Used for building **web applications** where the main objective is to return **views/pages** that users interact with in their web browsers (HTML, JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.).
